# Ethereum
## Overview and Origin

* Conception of Ethereum came about in 2013 with a white paper that was written by Vitalik Buterin which followed shortly after.

* In 2014 software developement for Ethereum began, titled EthSuisse GmbH or rather Ethereum Switzerland. Gmbh (Gesellschaft mit beschrankter Haftung) which is German for "company with limited liability". In the U.S. Gmbh would be the equivalent of Incorporating (Inc) or creating an Light Limited Company (LLC)
* Who are the **Founders** of the company? Etherum has had a long list of founders. **Vitalik Buterin** is the principal founder of Ethereum. Buterin a Russian born Canadian whos father was is also a computer scientist introduced Vitalik to Bitcoin at the age of 17. From a young age Vitalik showed high levels of intelligence and was placed into classes for gifted children. Vitalik showed particular intrest in mathematics, programming an economics. Among his greater achiements Vitalik would go on to win the Thiel Fellowship after publishing his white paper for Ethereum. At the time of development, Buterin was assited by several other developers. **Charles Hoskinson** who held the the position of CEO for a brief period of time but would later be removed from the position by Buterin in a dispute. Buterin believed the project would be better served as a non profit while Hoskinson opted for commercial position. Hoskinson would eventually leave Ethereum to found Cardano. **Gavin Wood**, an English computer scientist who worked at Microsoft as a research scientist prior to to joining Buterin. Gavin wrote the yello paper for Ethereum virtual machine (EVM), he proposed and help develope Solidity, a programming language for writing smart contracts for Ethereum. Gavin also founded Web3, a non profit focused on decentralization of internet infrastructure and technology. He would later go to co-found Polkadot and Kasuma. **Anthony Di Iorio**. A Canadian born entrepreneur, who began his career as as a marketing major, Di Iorio began creating websites and would move on as an investor in rental properties. In 2012 Di Iorio got wind of Bitcoin while listening to a podcast by the name of "Free Talk Live", later that year Di Iorio would divest his rental properties to invest in Bitcoin. In 2012 Di Iorio and a partner founded KryptoKit a Chrome wallet extension allowing users to purchase products using the cryptocurrency wallet. Vialik Buterin joined KryptoKit and Di Iorio would go on to become an Ethereum co-founder. **Joseph Lubin** a Canadian born entrepreneur with a background in electrical engineering and computer science was part of the early days of Etherum (EthSuisse) when Ethereum was in its incorporations stage in Switzerland Lubin served as COO. **Mihai Alisie** together with Vitalik Buterin created Bitcoin Magazine in 2011, Alisie was the acting Editor-in-Chief for the magazine and later went on to co-found Etherum with Buterin. **Amir Chetrit** a U.S. Israeli national met Vitalik Buterin in 2013 at the time Vitalik was working with Israeli startup Colored Coins. A year later at a co-founders meeting Chetrit was asked to step down as the other co-founders felt Chetrit was not pulling his weight. Chetrit accepted and moved on. 

* During the time that Vitalik was writing for Bitcoin Magazine, Vitalik wanted to build a decentralized application, Buterin was of the idea that Bitcoin along with Blockchain technology would be of benefit with the addition of other applications rather than just money. In order to build these applications Buterin concluded that he would need a more dynamic and powerful language.

* In 2014 Ethereum went through a crowdfunding campaign to raise capital for the development of Ethereum. At the time participants used Bitcoin to purchase ETH, Ethereum's digital coin currency. According to coindesk Ethereum sold 50 million coins at a price of $0.31 each rasing 16 million dollars. At the time of wrting this paper Ethereum's market cap is approximately $308,589,528,981.85 USD. 

* Ethereum is an open source, decentralized cryptographic hyperledger and is not intended for any one person but rather everyone. The purpose is to eliminate a one source governing body of people wich can be prone to bias, favortisim, or outright malice. Ethreeum instead uses consensus, cryptography and a network of miners to agree and execute the terms of a contract between two parties based on the logic in the contract. 

* Originally Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin wanted a decentralized network that was capable of more than just transfering money. In turn Ethereum's blockchain Eth cryptocurrency have rocked the foundation of finance with Fintech, by proving that banks, brokerages and many other financial institutions can be run by DApps, and DAO's. Etherum was the pioneer in the blockchain space, it paved the way for others to follow and other than being the first and most recognizable blockchain with a digital currency. Etherum's advantage over its competitors are many. For example Ethereum has a large community, less expenxive hardware requirments to become a Ethreum validator, and Ethereum is the most decentralized blockchain available. On the downside Ethereum is operating on a proff of work cryptographic protocol however Ethereum anounced that it will be moving to a proff of stake protocol in the near furture, enabaling Etherum to handel more transactions per second and lowering its gas fees.

* Ethreeum uses the EVM Ethereum virtual machine


## Landscape:

* Ethereum finds itself in a crossroads within the financial industy. Meaning, not only is Ethereum disrupting the financial industry the use and functionality of Ethereum, blockchain and digital currency can be applied to almost any application where two or more parties enter into a contract where execution takes place once the conditions of the contract are met without the use of a central entity. The contract is executed when the ctirera of the contract is met by the software algorithm. Logistics, healthcare, legal, voting, buying and selling are just a small fraction of how Ethereum's technology can be applied.

*  Ethereum has only been in existense less than a decade and because the Ethereum is fairly new. The traditional financial system has been unchanged and unchallenged up until 2014. That being said, many contries and traditionl financial sectors have begun to adapt to digital currency and blockchain technology. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain? Solana, Polkadot, Cardano


## Results

* Revolutionary! Ethereum first digital coins sold at a mere $0.31 per coin, fast forward to today and Ethereum's digital coin "ETH" is valued at approximatley $2500.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

*  At this current moment my companie does not use not use any type blockchain or cyrptocurrency. 


## Recommendations

* I would suggest the company enter sales contracts with customers via an intra-company blockchain. I would also implement blockchains in logistics. I predict that millions of dollars could be saved on lost consingment product.

*  It would save time and money. If products could be traced from engineering to customer. 

*  Medical research and the healthe insurance sectory would stand to benefit by speeding up reserach results and not allowing for latency due to poor decision and bureaucracy. 

* They could be scaled and adapted to an already established infrastructure.
